	<h1>General Overview</h1>
	<p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view.
	If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for
	information.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="WD34_Exercise2_Tena_DATASOURCES_BYSUBJECT-OVERVIEW.HTM">by Subject</a></dt>
		<dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</dd>
		<dt><a href="ByAccess.html">by Type</a></dt>
		<dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="index.html">About the W3 project</a>.</p>
